# youtuber=input("enter your favourite youtuber: ")

# these are ways to print any string
# 1st :print("subscribe to "+youtuber)
# 2nd: print("subscribe to {}".format(youtuber))
# 3rd: print(f"subscrie to {youtuber}") this is good way to make madlibs program using fstring

# madlibs project is based on string concatenation concept
adj=input("Ajective: ")
verb1=input("verb: ")
verb2=input("verb: ")
famous_per=input("Famous person you admire the most: ")
madlib=f"Computer programming is so {adj}! It makes me so excited all the time because \n I love to {verb1}. \
Stay hydrated and {verb2} like you are {famous_per} !"
print(madlib)
# so like this we can make multiple madlib games using simple string concatenation concept
