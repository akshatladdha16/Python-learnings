# Python-learnings
Complete and detailed python introductory codes with proper comments explaining the concepts
I have tried to explain everything I learned by myself in python in most simpliest language possibile .
So as a guide to anyone starting to take up my codes I would suggest start with intro python.py and then cover concepts like loops , dictionaries , functions, objects , classes etc.
I have learned python from freecodecamp YouTube tutorial on python for beginners that's the most fundamentally strong video i have seen for python . So anyone can start with that also
Even if my codes would help a single person who wants to start with python I would be so glad.
Thank you .
